This package will allow you to place object on top of each other without any hesitation or burden of placing some of it's part underneath the ground or inside the wall.

*************************
**********STEPS**********
*************************

1) Open the snap window from
Tools > Snaps > Open

2) Select any object you want to place on the ground or on the wall

3) Select the origin of the raycast(i.e. pivot or center of the selected object)

4) Choose the coordinate space to fire raycast in either world axis or local axis

5) Choose what type of snap your object would like to fit in

-None : The object will be snapped from it's pivot (world position)
-Mesh Bounds : The object will be snapped from it's mesh bounds if it has a mesh renderer attached
-Collider Bounds : if your object does not have mesh renderer, only collider attached, then this will work same as mesh bounds but will take collider bounds in calculation
-Group Bounds : if you have a group of objects, ready to be snapped, this will do the job

6) Press the desired axis button

There you go, your object is perfectly snapped along ground, celing, wall or any type of surface.

**********FEATURES**********
****************************

-Full undo and redo support
-You can also modify the code for your own requirements and do some more snapping
-Also there are some pre-made shortcuts to use the snaps easily with just two key strokes
the default shortcuts are following :
Alt+Num8 => Snap Forward
Alt+Num2 => Snap Back
Alt+Num4 => Snap Left
Alt+Num6 => Snap Right
Alt+Num5 => Snap Up
Alt+Num0 => Snap Down
-You can change these shortcuts like unity's other shortcuts from Edit > Shortcuts menu.

NOTE : The main thing here you have to take in count that the surface on which your object is going to be snapped, must have a collider attached, otherwise it will not work as intended
